# Project-Pizza-Sopranos

Project Pizza Sopranos is a website made for a Pizzaria called Sopranos. This was one of my first projects with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

This website has the option to check out the menu of the pizza's Sopranos has to offer AND the user can order the pizza they want. 
Since it's only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and there's no PHP or Javascript involved the ordering option doesn't actually work. 

Project Pizza Sopranos has a homepage, orderpage and a contactpage.
